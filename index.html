            <h2> About Me </h2>
            <p>Hi my name is Piper! As of right now I am 21 years old. Ever since I was 
            young I have had an interest in video games as well as technology. This led
            to my interest in learning about coding languages and programming. I have taken 
            a few classes on coding and am now taking the Software Engineering course with 
            Flatiron! My goal for this course is to expand my knowedge of coding languages 
            as well as learning more about what a job in the industry looks like. Thank you 
            for taking the time to check out my website! I hope you have a great day!</p>

                    A very simple calculator that can do addition, subtraction, multiplication,
                    and division. It was made using HTML and Javascript and was one of my first 
                    projects. Maybe one day I will add CSS styling to it.
